            <!--<h2><em>Description</em></h2>-->
            <p>The coconut, curry, and mango chutney really put the flavor in this one. I put this together one night with what I had, and I loved the results. It tastes better the next day, just like most chili. This freezes well. Seriously, you have to try it. Serve by itself, with rice, and/or with naan.</p>

            <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 pound ground turky</li>
                <li>2 (10.75 ounce) cans tomato soup</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped carrot</li>
                <li>1/4 cup mango chutney</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons curry powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 cup coconut milk, divided</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="directions">
            <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Break the ground turkey into small pieces into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the turkey, continuing to break it into smaller pieces, until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain as much grease as possible from the turkey.</li>
                <li>Combine tomato soup, water, and minced garlic in a large pot; bring to a boil. Add the turkey to the pot and return the mixture to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir chickpeas, red kidney beans, carrot, chutney, curry powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper through the turkey mixture; bring to a simmer, place a cover on the pot, and cook until the chickpeas are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir 1/4 cup coconut milk through the chili, return cover to the pot, and simmer another 15 minutes. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup coconut milk into the chili, stir, and simmer 30 minutes more.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2><em>Notes</em></h2>
            <ul><li>You could add diced potatoes or thinly sliced mango, as well. Taste and add whatever spices you think it may need. I like a lot of curry powder and coconut milk, so I usually add more. I prefer to let it simmer an additional 30 minutes beyond what is written here.</li></ul>
